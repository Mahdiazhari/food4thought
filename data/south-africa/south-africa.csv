Pure beef forms perfectly into a patty – you don’t need anything like onions, breadcrumbs, egg, spices, or salt and pepper. Your two clean hands are more than capable of making the patties, but a burger press will make the job even easier.\xa0Start the sauce by heating the olive oil in a small pot and then adding the onion and red pepper. Cook for a minute till soft and then add the garlic. Onion takes longer to cook, so start cooking that first before you add the garlic. This is advice in general and not only for this recipe.\xa0Add the chili powder and the paprika and stir to release the flavour. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and stock, and stir. Cook with the lid on and check on the sauce every now and then to make sure it doesn’t cook dry. You want the sauce to thicken but not burn. When you start braaing the patties, remove the lid so that the sauce can thicken more. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.\xa0Braai the patties on a grid over very hot coals. They should take about 8 minutes all in all and be flipped only once. To stop the patties from sticking to your grid, try these tips:\xa0Use a grid with wider rods.Spray the grid with non-stick spray.Carefully place the patties on the grid so that they don’t push through the grid.Braai over very hot coals so that the patties seal before they sink through the grid.Wiggle the patties a little bit with your braai tongs or spatula when you start braaiing them so that the patties can seal. The more the meat cooks, the less it will stick to the grid. Turn the patties once and do it very carefully.\xa0Cut the rolls in half and brush some oil on the cut side. Heat them a little on the grid, but be careful not to grill them too much. (We stay away from the word burn.)\xa0Build the burger: Start with one half of a roll, then add the patty, the Freedom Fighter sauce, a spoonful of sour cream and chopped parsley, before topping with the other half of the roll.\xa0']",4 servings,,PT5M,PT20M

I weighed mine into 30g portions which were perfect. Pop the balls into the freezer to set for 1 hour. This will make them easy to coat in chocolate.Once ready to coat, melt your dark chocolate in a ceramic bowl in the microwave, stirring every 15 seconds until fully melted.To keep the chocolate runny while I work, I like to place the bowl into a larger bowl of hot water. Be super careful to ensure no water gets into the chocolate, or it will seize.Take a toothpick and skewer one of the cake balls. Dip it into the chocolate to evenly coat, shake off the excess chocolate, then pop the other end of the toothpick into some clay (or any of the items suggested above) to allow the cake truffle to set. Repeat with the remaining truffles.Once all the truffles are coated and the chocolate is firm, place them in the freezer while you melt your white chocolate (leave the tooth picks in!)Melt the white chocolate as per the instructions above. Remove the truffles from the freezer. In one hand hold the tooth pick, in your other hand have a spoon of melted chocolate ready. Start to drizzle the white chocolate in a thin steam, spinning the tooth pick as you go to “wrap” the chocolate cake truffle in its “mummy bandages”. While the white chocolate is a little soft, add on your candy eyes to finish your mummy heads. As above, place the toothpick into clay to allow the chocolate to set.If you want to add more decoration you can add various mouths and embellishments to your mummies with fondant icing.*replace the amarula for coffee, milk mixed with vanilla, or chocolate milk.

Caramelised onions keep well in the fridge for a few days.Braai the steak or steaks over very hot coals for 8 minutes in total until medium rare. You can season the meat just before, during or after the braai, depending on when you believe it’s best to season meat.The steaks need to rest before you slice them. This should be for at least 5 minutes, but can be for a few hours as well, as it’s entirely acceptable to use cold steak for this sandwich. When you slice the steaks, lie them flat on a cutting board and go in at a 45-degree angle instead of straight down. This allows you to slice through the fibres in the meat an additional time, resulting in even more tender slices of meat. If you struggle to produce neat, thin slices, you need to sharpen your chef’s or carving knife (or you need a new knife altogether).Butter or oil the slices of bread and toast on the grid, taking care not to over-toast (burn) them.To assemble the sandwich: Bread, mustard, lettuce, steak strips, caramelised onion, mayonnaise on the other slice of bread, bread.Extract from Jan Braai&#8217;s latest cookbook, JanBraai Braaibroodjies and Burgers which also available in Afrikaans.\xa0']",4 servings,Cuisine,PT15M,PT30M

Light the fire. You need fewer coals than when braaing steak, but you&rsquo;ll need a steady supply of coals once the pudding is baking. 2. Use butter to grease your no. 10 flat-bottomed baking potjie. You can see a picture of this kind of potjie on page XXX. 3. Sift the flour and the bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl and stir in the sugar (you don&rsquo;t need to sift the sugar). 4. In another mixing bowl, whisk the egg very well. Now add the jam, vinegar, butter and milk, whisking well after adding each ingredient. 5. Add the wet ingredients of step 5 to the dry ingredients of step 4 and mix well with a wooden spoon. 6. Pour the batter into the potjie, put on the lid and bake for 50 minutes by placing some coals underneath the potjie and some coals on top of the lid. Don&rsquo;t add too much heat, as burning is a big danger. There is no particular risk in having too little heat and taking up to 1 hour to get the baking done, so rather go too slow than too fast. During this time, you can add a few fresh hot coals to the bottom and top of the potjie whenever you feel the pudding is losing steam. After roughly 50 minutes of baking, it should be well risen and brown. 7. When the pudding has been baking in the potjie for about 40 minutes (about 10 minutes before it is done), heat all the ingredients for the sauce in a small potjie over medium coals. Keep stirring to ensure that the butter is melted and the sugar is completely dissolved, but don&rsquo;t let the mixture boil. If you want a (slightly) less sweet pudding, use half a cup of sugar and a full cup of hot water for the sauce, instead of the other way round as per the ingredients list. My parents actually prefer it this way. 8. After about 50 minutes of baking, insert a skewer into the middle of the pudding to test whether it&rsquo;s done. If the skewer comes out clean, it&rsquo;s ready. 9. Take the pudding off the fire and pour the sauce evenly over it. Believe me, it will absorb all the sauce &ndash; you just need to leave it standing for a few minutes. Serve the malva pudding warm with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, a dollop of fresh cream or a puddle of vanilla custard. A good way to keep it hot is to put it near the fire, but not too close &ndash; after doing everything right, we don&rsquo;t want it to burn now.TIP: In the original recipe, the tot measures of apricot jam, butter and vinegar as well as the half tot of bicarbonate of soda are all given as 1 tablespoon each. These minor changes won&rsquo;t affect the outcome of the dessert but for the sake of accurately recording history, I think it&rsquo;s important that we note it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan Braai The Vegetarian Option is published by Bookstorm.

Mix well before spreading the rub over the fish (both sides).Slice the citrus fruits and add roughly 6 to 8 slices of each fruit to the container. You can lie the fruit slices on top of or alongside the fish. Seal the container and leave in the fridge overnight or for a minimum of 8 hours.After the fish has been cured overnight, you can remove the container from the fridge and rinse all the curing ingredients off the snoek.Rinse the fish thoroughly or your final product may be overwhelmingly salty.Also rinsing off your fruit slices and fresh herbs to reuse in the baking process is a great idea as this gives your snoek an intense flavour!Pat the snoek dry using kitchen paper towels or a clean dishtowel.Preheat your oven to 200 degrees celsius.Place the fish skin-side down on an oven tray and drizzle with olive oil.Place the herbs and citrus slices you salvaged from the curing stage on one half of the snoek and fold the undressed side over (to cover the dressed side, like a little snoek sandwich).Score 3 deep cuts across the snoek skin, drizzle with olive oil, and repeat on the other side.Bake the snoek in the preheated oven for 20 – 25min.While your snoek is in the oven, finely mince the onion, chilli, ginger and garlic. Sauté in a pan with a little olive oil and butter.You don’t want to colour this too much, you are just looking to cook the onions through and bring them up to a little caramel colour. Remove from plate and allow to cool.When the snoek is cooked, remove it from the oven. Put aside and allow to cool.When cool enough to handle, open up the fish, remove all herbs and citrus slices, and then flake all the fish into a kitchen processor bowl, removing all bones and skin (Always make sure that you clean your hands thoroughly or wear kitchen gloves before handling the meat).Add any juices that are left in the roasting tray to the flaked snoek, and discard the skin and bones.Add the onion mix to the flaked snoek along with the cream cheese, cream and season with a little salt and pepper.Put the bowl into the food processor and blitz or mince until all the ingredients are well combined. You can decide just how smooth or textured you would like your pâté to be.Add lemon juice to taste.Serving Suggestion:Serve with mosbolletjie toast, beetroot &amp; rosemary pickled onions, coriander and an aromatic papaya curry.Pairs perfectly with the Lanzerac Chenin Blanc.Notes:Be wary not to overprocess the pâté in pursuit of a smooth texture or you risk churning the cream cheese to the point of producing a lumpy pâté with a fatty texture.For a more rustic, textured pâté, try whisking the final mixture by hand instead of using a food processor.Recipe by chef Stephen Fraser of\xa0Lanzerac Hotel and Spa.']",6 servings,Bake,PT45M,PT30M

Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.2. Cut aubergine lengthwise into 1 cm slices. Lay on a baking tray on baking paper. Try not to overlap them. Brush a thin layer of oil over each slice on both sides. Sprinkle salt, paprika and oregano over all of the slices. Bake until completely soft in the middle and a knife can pierce through easily like butter. (NB. This is a very important step, if the aubergine is not fully cooked and the flesh is not soft and still has a bite, it will be a very unpleasant texture to eat.) This should take at least 20 minutes, but it depends on the thickness of each slice.3. Cut the mushrooms lengthwise into thick slices. You will get about 3-4 slices from each mushroom depending on the size of the mushroom. Lay the mushroom slices evenly on a baking tray. Try not to overlap them. Sprinkle with olive oil and salt. Roast in the oven until cooked but still plump and juicy, about 10- 15 minutes.4. In the food processor, mix the olive oil, basil, mayo (hold the mayo or use vegan mayo if 100% vegan), garlic and salt together until it forms a smooth sauce.5. Cut the rolls in half and toast the inside of the rolls on the grill. If a grill is not available, you can toast them in the oven (facing up) for about 30 seconds at 180 degrees Celsius.6. On the inside of the roll, bottom and top, layer a thin layer of the basil mayo sauce. Place a slice or two (depending on size of the slice) of aubergine on the bottom roll so that it covers the roll. Then add a few mushroom slices, followed by the lettuce, and tomato.&nbsp;Recipe published with permission of\xa0\xa0Humane Society International/Africa.\xa0For more plant-based and vegan deliciousness visit our vegan hub\xa0here.To receive quick and convenient weekday recipes, join our\xa0Easy Weekday Meals\xa0mailing list, and for up-to-date trending food, restaurant and wine news subscribe to our\xa0Editor’s Weekly newsletter.\xa0\xa0']",6 servings,Budget,PT30M,PT15M

Divide the batter between the prepared moulds &#8211; filling them to 3/4 full &#8211; then bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden but springy to the touch (a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake should come out clean). Allow the Tinkies to cool slightly before removing from the foil moulds.To make the filling, place the egg whites and salt in a large metal or glass bowl over a pot of gently simmering water and whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually add the caster sugar while whisking until the mixture is stiff and hot to the touch. Remove from the heat and whisk until cooled (preferably with an electrical mixer) then add the vanilla. With the mixer running, slowly and gradually add the butter in small blobs, whisking well in between, until a fluffy buttercream forms. Place the frosting in a piping bag fitted with a medium straight nozzle.Fill the Tinkies by pressing the piping bag nozzle into the bottom of the cakes at three different points and releasing the frosting inside each cake.Makes 8-10Recipe reprinted with permission of Katelyn Williams.To receive quick and convenient weekday recipes, join our Easy Weekday Meals mailing list, and for up-to-date trending food, restaurant and wine news subscribe to our Editor’s Weekly newsletter.']",8 servings,Bake,PT30M,PT15M

After five minutes add the flour and oil and mix well, then add the salt. Don&rsquo;t add salt directly to yeast as it can kill it.

Then place the kneaded dough in a clean, oiled bowl in a warm area and leave for at least 40 minutes to allow the dough to rise.Make the sauce Place all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to the boil over medium heat, stirring continuously. Reduce heat and continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until the tomatoes are mushy right through. Blend to a spreadable puree.Braai the pizza: Test the coals, if you can hold your hand over the grid for 5 seconds, they should be ready. It&rsquo;s best to keep a continuous fire that produces coals so you can maintain a constant heat. Roll a fist-sized piece of the proved dough out into thin circles. Dust your surface with flour if the dough sticks.Place the dough on the grid to cook one side and give it a chance to rise. After about 2-3 minutes, flip the dough over using a spatula and, working very quickly, spread some of the pureed tomato over the entire surface. Top with some mozzarella, a handful of cherry tomatoes and then finish off with chopped oregano. Season to taste.Place the lid of a saucepan or wok over the pizza, putting some coals on top of the lid to allow the toppings to cook as well. This should take about 5-7 minutes, but keep checking the bottom of the pizza to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t burn.Remove the lid and use a spatula to remove your crispy pizza.Tips:When experimenting with your favourite toppings, try to pre-cook the ingredients where possible.It&rsquo;s easier to buy dough at a bakery and use diced canned tomatoes, but nothing beats freshly prepared ingredients.It also helps to lightly grease the grid with vegetable oil.Source: Home magazineTo receive quick and convenient weekday recipes, join our Easy Weekday Meals mailing list, and for up-to-date trending food, restaurant and wine news subscribe to our Editor&rsquo;s Weekly newsletter.']",6 small pizzas servings,Braai,PT40M,PT20M

You can add as many chillies as you wish but remember that you can never expect your guests to eat a sauce that is too hot for them. If, like me, you like quite a lot of burn then it might be wise to mix two batches, one with fewer chillies.Do not touch your eyes or any other sensitive parts of your body while you are making this sauce as the traces of chilli juice left on your hands will burn those sensitive parts. Go and wash your hands to get the chilli juices off them, and then still be careful.The sauce can be used immediately but will improve with age and last in your fridge for weeks.The use of peri-peri chillies and sauces filtered into South Africa from our Portuguese-speaking neighbouring countries Mozambique and Angola. The peri-peri (also called African Bird’s Eye or Piri-Piri) chilli is a member of the Capsicum family of chillies. Compared to the average chilli it’s quite small and very hot.If you can’t get hold of it, use any small and potent chilli. But best is to get yourself a plant and cultivate them at home; they grow quite easily in most parts of South Africa.

Alternatively use some part ofyour multi-tool to make those holes but be careful not to injure yourself.Light the charcoal fire and set up your Man-Oven for indirect grilling. In a Kamado-style oven this means using the deflector plate; in a kettle braai this means having two heaps of coals on the sides of the bottom grid and leaving the middle of the bottom grid open.If relevant, ensure that you remove the little bag of giblets from the cavity of the chicken.Rub the chicken inside and out with the braai spice.Push the can prepared in step 1 into the cavity of the chicken.Place the chicken standing upright (with the can inside also facing upright) into the middle of the top grid of your Man-Oven and pack the potatoes around it.Close the lid of the Man-Oven and bake the chicken for 1 hour at 180°C. Make sure that the bottom and top air vents are open, otherwise the coals will smother and die.Do not open the lid for the next 50 minutes.After 50 minutes to 1 hour the chicken will be ready.

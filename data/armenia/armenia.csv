One of my aunts who visited Armenia recently came back with tales of a very beautiful country with pristine lakes, lush valleys, majestic mountains, ancient monasteries and churches galore and captivating art and archeological sights; as well as fabulous, fresh, foods. My interest in Armenia is reinforced by the fact that, like Lebanon, it is a country that has suffered many tragedies especially in the last hundred years and yet its people have remained stoic and kept plowing forward. Like Lebanon, it is a country that is placed in a strategic spot and thus has endured many invasions. And like Lebanon, it is a country whose diaspora is greater in number than the Armenians actually living in Armenia.”', 'That said, Joumana went to great lengths to prepare Topig, and provide step-by-step photos.

One of my aunts who visited Armenia recently came back with tales of a very beautiful country with pristine lakes, lush valleys, majestic mountains, ancient monasteries and churches galore and captivating art and archeological sights; as well as fabulous, fresh, foods. My interest in Armenia is reinforced by the fact that, like Lebanon, it is a country that has suffered many tragedies especially in the last hundred years and yet its people have remained stoic and kept plowing forward. Like Lebanon, it is a country that is placed in a strategic spot and thus has endured many invasions.

The puri is basically a matnakash without the furrows, just a line down the center (probably made with a knife).

It’s usually eaten w/cheese, etc., is long and rectangular in shape, very thick, soft and delicious. As a matter of fact, if you look at the cover of my book I have two of them standing up on the right hand side (right behind the choeregs).

One of my aunts who visited Armenia recently came back with tales of a very beautiful country with pristine lakes, lush valleys, majestic mountains, ancient monasteries and churches galore and captivating art and archeological sights; as well as fabulous, fresh, foods. My interest in Armenia is reinforced by the fact that, like Lebanon, it is a country that has suffered many tragedies especially in the last hundred years and yet its people have remained stoic and kept plowing forward. Like Lebanon, it is a country that is placed in a strategic spot and thus has endured many invasions. And like Lebanon, it is a country whose diaspora is greater in number than the Armenians actually living in Armenia.”', 'That said, Joumana went to great lengths to prepare Topig, and provide step-by-step photos.
